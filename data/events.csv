"Halloween & It's Creepy Irish Origins Walking Tour","Event","Want a chilling experience? Halloween was a Christian superimposition on the ancient Irish pagan feast of Samhain, which was held at the end of October every year. The Celtic people had great reverence for their ancestors but also feared them, and on this day the portal between this world and the next opened, and good and (mostly) evil spirits roamed the land and people came up with various tactics to protect themselves from wandering malevolent creatures. 

Many famous Irish writers created their own spectral figures based on our traditions, and have given us creepy tales such as The Portrait of Dorian Grey, Melmoth the Wanderer, Carmilla and, not forgetting, Dracula. We’ll dip into all of this and try to avoid getting splashed in blood!","https://www.walkingtours.ie/","https://www.walkingtours.ie/public-tours","0035318329406","0035318329406","The Tree Of Gold","The Tree Of Gold, 38 Dame St, Temple Bar, Dublin","Dublin","53.3443852","-6.263221799999999","No","25","31/10/2024","31/10/2024",,,"No"

A graduate of MTU Cork School of Music, Harry is continuing his composition studies at Oxford where the Castalian Quartet premiered his fine Summer Idyll earlier this year. Brahms’ C minor quartet is one of the greats, its dramatic and impassioned outer movements contrasting with the sublime beauty and lyricism of the Romanze and the relaxed musings of the third movement.

"Dave Hause","Event","Dave Hause’s songs have always been rooted in tangible reality- of emotion, of environment, of circumstance.

Since releasing his debut album, Resolutions, in 2011, the Philadelphia-born songwriter has poured his whole heart, soul and life into his music. That’s no different on Drive It Like It’s Stolen, his sixth full-length. Its 10 songs overflow with Hause’s trademark urgency and passion, shimmering with a truth that reflects the harsh realities of life in this day and age, as well the intermittent jolts of joy that punctuate it. After all, his songs have always detailed his own personal traumas and triumphs within the setting of an unforgiving capitalist backdrop, tethering those personal experiences to ineluctable external forces.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/dave-hause/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873648755","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","20","21/02/2025","21/02/2025",,,"No"

"The Dublin Jazz Co-op presents Three Thirds","Event","Its a simple recipe really: Tristan Guillaume (Le.Musketrio, Boost) lays down the groove. Antoine Brunet (we call him Tony) (Lapsus, Troy von Balthazar) locks in with popping bass lines. Thomas Salvatore (Who Parked The Car, NoTap, Laura Wamba) adds himself to the sound creating sparks with his luscious chords and electric figures. To complete the sound, these three friends sing 3 part harmonies.

The communication and chemistry displayed on stage is electric. They improvise through their original songs, making every performance a unique one where each member contributing their own unique talents creates an unforgettable experience for the audience.

"The Dublin Jazz Co-op presents Keith Tobin Quartet","Event","Keith Tobin seamlessly blends the dynamic grooves of jazz, rock, funk, and pop into his rich soundscapes. His deep love for the smooth, groove-laden worlds of Jamiroquai and Massive Attack finds a unique counterpoint in his affection for the gritty, down-tuned riffs of Alice in Chains. This eclectic taste becomes the backbone of Shy Mascot's distinctive sound—a fluid blend of trip-hop, jazz, funk, and hip hop.

While Shy Mascot fuses the ethereal atmospheres of trip-hop, the syncopated swing of jazz, the insistent grooves of funk, and the introspective depth of hip hop, it is Keith's bass lines that underpin and perhaps even propel this act's eclectic musical architecture.","https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/the-dublin-jazz-co-op-presents-keith-tobin-quartet-tickets-1002875677147?aff=ebdssbdestsearch&keep_tld=1","https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/the-dublin-jazz-co-op-presents-keith-tobin-quartet-tickets-1002875677147?aff=ebdssbdestsearch&keep_tld=1","003531234567","003531234567","The Workman's Club","The Workman's Club, 10 Wellington Quay, Temple Bar, Dublin","Dublin","53.3453972","-6.266419399999999","No","12","06/10/2024","06/10/2024",,,"No"

Unlikely housemates, they try to find a connection in the short time they’re here – and a space for themselves amongst the stuff of her entire life.

"No Citation","Event","After breaking into derelict Dimitri’s Piano Bar, McCarthy attempts to treat his audience to an evening of his latest songs, but finds he’s being interrupted by ghosts from his past. As the realisation dawns on him that this may be his last gig ever, he tries to set the record straight.

Interwoven with original songs, Kyron Bourke’s musical drama No Citation is having its first Dublin run at Smock Alley after a sellout premiere in Belfast’s Lyric Theatre. Born in Dublin, the now Belfast-based Bourke is considered something of a town minstrel, an outsider telling tales in song of heartbreak, guilt and human experience.

"No Citation","Event","After breaking into derelict Dimitri’s Piano Bar, McCarthy attempts to treat his audience to an evening of his latest songs, but finds he’s being interrupted by ghosts from his past. As the realisation dawns on him that this may be his last gig ever, he tries to set the record straight.

Interwoven with original songs, Kyron Bourke’s musical drama No Citation is having its first Dublin run at Smock Alley after a sellout premiere in Belfast’s Lyric Theatre. Born in Dublin, the now Belfast-based Bourke is considered something of a town minstrel, an outsider telling tales in song of heartbreak, guilt and human experience.

"Alice Kiernan","Event","Alice began singing, playing guitar and writing songs at the age of 12 and by the age of 16 began her music career by gigging and performing in venues around Dublin and Ireland.

"MANA","Event","Their lyrics are inspired by how polarised and cynical the world has become, in which people are left bitter, undermined and fragmented. The songs embody communal disenchantment whilst also offering a sense of solace, solidarity and hope for the future.

With support from Molly Vulpyne

"The Last Waltz","Event","THE BAND, one of the most respected musical groups during the late ’60’s and early ’70’s ended their decade-and-a-half career with a final concert in San Francisco in 1976. They brought together one of the greatest lineups of rock musicians ever assembled on one stage, including Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Eric Clapton. 

The entire event was filmed by director Martin Scorsese and some of the world’s leading cinematographers. It’s a poignant, close-up look at a spectacular musical celebration, captured with an intimate film style never before used for this type of movie. THE LAST WALTZ not only spotlights a wealth of great music, but serves as a salute to the end of an era.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/the-last-waltz/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873649323","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","10.50","07/10/2024","07/10/2024",,,"No"

Gaining recognition for his showmanship and captivating stage presence, Sheehy's blend of energy and intimacy make his live shows truly unmissable.","https://www.inec.ie/gigs/pa-sheehy/","https://www.ticketmaster.ie/pa-sheehy-co-kerry-14-12-2024/event/180060F0E5128327?_ga=2.137989744.17276057.1727254463-1772176490.1727254463","00353646671555","00353646671555","Gleneagle INEC Arena","Gleneagle INEC Arena, Muckross Rd, Poulnamuck, Killarney, Kerry","Kerry","52.04446599999999","-9.502486","No","29","14/12/2024","14/12/2024",,,"No"

"Villagers","Event","The exquisite new album unfurls O’Brien’s trademark melodic flair, his gift for simultaneously vivid and subtle arrangements and lyrics that couch his hopes, fears and dreams in richly absorbing poetry. That Golden Time takes its name from the fifth track, which doubles as the album’s lead single. “I wanted the warmth of the record reflected in its title,” O’Brien explains. “The song also touches on a theme that keeps cropping up, of romanticism versus realism. How can you have aspirational ideas about yourself and the world around you, whilst being confronted with a harsh, cold reality? The friction interested me.”

"Bram Stoker Festival 2024","Festival","Bram Stoker Festival celebrates the legacy of one of Ireland’s most beloved and iconic writers.

The festival draws inspiration from Stoker, his life, his work, the Dublin of his time and celebrates the Gothic, the supernatural, the after-dark and the Victorian. Over the years, we’ve presented major outdoor spectacles and installations; intimate experiences on hallowed grounds; world premieres of new scores for classic films and award winning theatre productions; outdoor circus at night in dark, foreboding forests; comedy in nightclubs; choral ensembles in darkened libraries; food tours where participants dined on custom menus; elaborate banquets in sacred crypts.

"Ed Byrne: Tragedy plus Time","Event","Born in County Dublin in 1972, Byrne found a talent in comedy during university in Glasgow, where he put on The Comedy Cellar, where he booked fellow aspiring comedians while developing his own observational style.

Byrne's popularity snowballed throughout the 00s, with shows such as Me Again, Standing Up, Falling Down and Warming Up in the Cold. He also recorded comedy specials including Pedantic and Whimsical, Crowd Pleaser and Roaring Forties.

"James Joyce Walking Tour","Event","The James Joyce Centre offers two public walking tours of the city based on Joyce’s life and work: Introducing Joyce's Dublin and Footsteps of Leopold Bloom.

Though Joyce lived most of his life outside of Ireland, Dublin would provide the backdrop for virtually all of his work. On a stroll around the inner city, our guide will explain the real-life inspiration behind some of Joyce’s most celebrated writing, demonstrating just how central the streetscape of the ‘Hibernian metropolis’ was to the author’s life and art. The tour visits such stops as Belvedere College, the Gresham Hotel, the James Joyce Statue, Davy Byrnes, and the National Library.

This is an excellent and fun introduction to Joyce in a bustling part of the city.","https://jamesjoyce.ie/","https://jamesjoyce.ie/book-a-walking-tour/","0035318788547","0035318788547","James Joyce Centre","35 N Great George's St, Rotunda, Dublin","Dublin","53.3541941","-6.259980499999998","No","20","16/12/2023","16/12/2023","20:30","21:40","Yes"
"Jakob Bro Trio feat Joey Baron & Thomas Morgan: ECM Artists & Collaborations","Event","In 2016, this superlative trio of Jakob Bro on electric guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and the legendary Joey Baron on drums & percussion issued one of ECM Records’ finest albums, Streams. Speaking of their collaboration in Downbeat, critic Ken Micallef, who gave the resulting album a 4 and a half(!) of out of 4 stars writes: “Bro refers to his compositions as ‘moods and textures’, and bassist Thomas Morgan and drummer Joey Baron freely explore these vistas with endless freedom.”

“As a group, we’ve been working more on ideas based around different time feelings as well as steady pulses,” Bro says.

Those “pulses” are the essence of the trio’s dialogue. Melodies erupt as if already written, many sounding oddly familiar.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/jakob-bro-trio-featuring-thomas-morgan-and-joey-baron/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873647095","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","40","27/10/2024","27/10/2024",,,"No"

"Hilary Heron: A Retrospective","Event","Hilary Heron: A Retrospective celebrates the pioneering work of modernist sculptor Hilary Heron (1923 – 1977). Hilary Heron was a Dublin born sculptor who co-represented Ireland at the 1956 Venice Biennale alongside painter Louis le Brocquy (1916 – 2012). 

As the first major retrospective exhibition of Heron’s work since 1964, this exhibition will seek to correct the ways that her work has been overlooked in Irish and international histories of modern sculpture. It will bring together work from national and international collections, including carvings, welding and castings. Heron was a master welder, a practice highly unusual for an Irish artist, let alone a woman in the 1950s.

"Donegal Town 550th","Event","In 2024, Donegal Town presents an exciting calendar of events celebrating the town's 550th Anniversary.

Its origins can be traced back to 1474, when Lady Nuala O'Donnell established a Franciscan Abbey on the shores of Donegal Bay.

The Town of Donegal grew up around these two great buildings and became the capital of Tir Chonaill.

"James Joyce Walking Tour","Event","The James Joyce Centre offers two public walking tours of the city based on Joyce’s life and work: Introducing Joyce's Dublin and Footsteps of Leopold Bloom.

Though Joyce lived most of his life outside of Ireland, Dublin would provide the backdrop for virtually all of his work. On a stroll around the inner city, our guide will explain the real-life inspiration behind some of Joyce’s most celebrated writing, demonstrating just how central the streetscape of the ‘Hibernian metropolis’ was to the author’s life and art. The tour visits such stops as Belvedere College, the Gresham Hotel, the James Joyce Statue, Davy Byrnes, and the National Library.

This is an excellent and fun introduction to Joyce in a bustling part of the city.","https://jamesjoyce.ie/","https://jamesjoyce.ie/book-a-walking-tour/","0035318788547","0035318788547","James Joyce Centre","35 N Great George's St, Rotunda, Dublin","Dublin","53.3541941","-6.259980499999998","No","20","12/01/2024","12/01/2024","20:30","21:40","Yes"

Both Gruff and Bill released critically acclaimed albums just weeks apart; Bill’s Iechyd Da and Gruff’s Sadness Sets You Free arrived in January 2024 and found themselves frequently mentioned in the same breath.

Therefore it wasn’t a giant leap of logic to take to the road together with full bands in tow to round off a special year. Headliners will switch each night, with both artists playing a full headline length set.

It drags McNamara’s book into the 21st Century while echoing life in “small town Ireland”.

The show in 2023 sold out completely two weeks before it opened at the Gaiety Theatre and was described by critics as: “Trading in wild theatricality on such a glorious scale it’s impossible to resist”.

"Real or Vision? The Northern Renaissance","Event","In Northern Europe during the fifteenth century, we encounter the meeting point of the radically real with the vibrantly visionary. We explore the photo-realism of Jan Van Eyck, whose Ghent Altarpiece still mystifies viewers through its rendition of real textures and profusion of lifelike characters, as well as the frightening hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch, whose nightmarish hybrid demons recall Salvador Dalí at his most surreal. 

We also see how the rise of printmaking was a force for the development of new imagery and ideas, Albrecht Dürer harnessing the technology in the service of humanistic self-expression, while the early expressions of Protestant reform embraced the medium as a means to spread urgent messages.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-autum-lecture-series-5/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873647953","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","15/10/2024","15/10/2024",,,"No"

Their programme opens with Beethoven’s light-hearted A major quartet from his Op.18 set of six quartets, written as he was turning 30 years of age. Modelled on Mozart’s A major quartet K.464 written just 15 years earlier, it features an extraordinary set of variations and a scampering, energised finale.

"The Early Renaissance: A New Art","Event","What happens when devout Christianity meets the revival of pagan antiquity, and when the virtues of modesty and spirituality clash with the desire for wealth and status? In the immediate wake of the Black Death, Europe, particularly Italy, witnessed the answer to this question. The Renaissance was a period rife with tensions and contradictions: Christian and pagan, rich and poor, piety and self-aggrandisement, artistic freedom and patronal control. 

We explore these tensions and innovations through the complex and beautiful art of Donatello, Masaccio, Botticelli, and more, examining their radical depiction of the human form, their reinvention of illusionistic space, and their marriage of Classical form with Christian faith.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-autum-lecture-series-4/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873647953","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","08/10/2024","08/10/2024",,,"No"
"The High Renaissance & the ‘Genius Artist’","Event","The 16th century saw the creation of the artist-celebrity for the first time in history. Through their prodigious skill and innovation, artists such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael were able to achieve an unprecedented level of fame which freed them to an extent from the pressures of patronal control. These artists are among the first to be subject to biographies within their own lifetime, and Michelangelo seized the opportunity to create a mythology around his genius. 

This week, we foreground these artists’ most well-known works, questioning how far the artists’ claims about their own genius hold true. We also explore how the nature of their innovation addressed issues surrounding questions of physical beauty and sexuality.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-autum-lecture-series-6/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873647953","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","22/10/2024","22/10/2024",,,"No"

There seems to be no stopping their spectacular rise, with sold out tours in the US and UK and even bigger plans to come.  Whether you understand half of what they're saying or not, you won't want to miss them...

"In Illo Tempore | Chamber Choir Ireland & Paul Hillier","Event","After 16 years at the helm of Chamber Choir Ireland, Paul Hillier marks his final performance with an exquisite programme of sacred choral music from Renaissance Venice.

The programme opens with Nicolas Gombert's intricate and optimistic motet, In illo tempore, meaning 'at that time', published in Venice in 1539.

Over sixty years later, Claudio Monteverdi took inspiration from Gombert in his 'Missa in illo tempore', drawing from 10 different themes from the original motet.

Weaving together the work of two crucial transitional figures in the shift from Renaissance to Baroque, each section of Monteverdi's six-part mass is followed by a motet by Giovani Gabrieli, from the joyful Plaudite omnis terra to the serene O magnum mysterium.","https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/in-illo-tempore-tickets-990504273947?aff=Failte","https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/in-illo-tempore-tickets-990504273947?aff=Failte","00353860836380","","Pepper Canister Church","Pepper Canister Church, 7 Mount St Cres, Dublin, Dublin","Dublin","53.33678339999999","-6.2434527","No","20","13/10/2024","13/10/2024",,,"No"

"John Blek and the Broken Strings","Event","John Blek's music is written from such a personal place that it creates the sense that he grew up with these songs, that they are in his blood – and in a way he did, they are his thoughts, his words, his sounds and his stories. Though not all autobiographical, like many of the great painters, an element of the artist exists in every portrait.

While Blek is a solo artist he regularly collaborates and, indeed, will write new music with collaborators in mind. As a result, it never feels like another artist is merely gate crashing his music; instead it works as a beautiful harmonious meeting of artists who understand each other.

He is joined by the Dresden based band ""The Broken Strings"" with whom he has collaborated for his album ""Cheer Up"".","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/john-blek-and-the-broken-strings/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873646376","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","22.50","19/10/2024","19/10/2024",,,"No"

His work explores the ephemeral nature of memory, identity and fantasy and how these things are intertwined to form augmented fictions.

The work takes the philosopher Gaston Bachelardʼs seminal text ‘The Poetics of Space’ as a model through which to explore the ability of objects to act as totems of personal meaning.

"Joseph Heffernan Residency","Event","Joseph Heffernan is a Cork-based visual artist, primarily a painter but also working in sculpture and assemblage. 

His work explores the ephemeral nature of memory, identity and fantasy and how these things are intertwined to form augmented fictions. It can best be understood as a mapping of interior mental spaces as well as an attempt to reconcile the real exterior world with those spaces. The work takes the philosopher Gaston Bachelardʼs seminal text ‘The Poetics of Space’ as a model through which to explore the ability of objects to act as totems of personal meaning.

Consisting of four movements and written when the composer was just sixteen years of age, Mendelssohn’s Octet in E-Flat Major was the first of its kind for eight string players, artfully marrying the intimacy of a chamber music formation with the fuller sound world of symphonic strings.

"The Sceptical Suffragette","Event","A woman who fought for working class women to have an equal status in society, who supported the Irish struggle for independence much to the chagrin of her English family and friends. Sylvia suffered cruel force feeding in Holloway prison as well as sexual violence. Yet she became sceptical of the direction of her feminist sisters and found herself marginalised. Her verbal battles with her manic sister Christabel and her Mother Emmeline are by times hilarious and bytimes filled with pathos. 

A play deeply dramatic with moments of great laughter. Audiences can expect to be gripped by the tension, informed by the story and entertained by the comedy.
